\begin{abstract}
We present detailed measurements of the redshift path density, equivalent width distribution, column density distribution, and redshift evolution of ${\MgII}$ absorbers as measured in archival VLT/UVES and Keck/HIRES spectra. This survey examines 432 VLT/UVES spectra from the UVES SQUAD collaboration and 170 Keck/HIRES spectra from the KODIAQ group, allowing for detections of intervening ${\MgII}$ absorbers spanning redshifts $0.1 < z < 2.6$. We employ an accurate, automated approach to line detection which consistently detects redshifted absorption lines. We measure the equivalent widths, apparent optical depth column densities, and velocity widths for each absorbing system. Using our complete sample of all detectable ${\MgII}$ absorbers, we can accurately determine the redshift path density of absorbers across cosmic time. We measure evolution in the comoving ${\MgII}$ line density, $dN\,/dX$, finding more high equivalent width absorbers at $z = 2$ than at present. We also measure evolution in the equivalent width distribution, parameterized by a Schechter function fit, finding a shallower weak-end slope for absorbers at redshifts between $1.53 < z < 2.64$, with $\alpha = -0.81$, compared to absorbers between $0.14 < z < 0.78$, where $\alpha = -1.09$. Finally, we calculate the cosmic mass fraction of ${\MgII}$ using the column density distribution, finding that $\Omega_{\MgII}$ increases from $\Omega_{\MgII} \simeq 0.9\times10^{-8}$ at $<z>\,= 0.49$ to $\Omega_{\MgII} \simeq 1.4\times10^{-8}$ at $<z>\,= 2.1$. After examining cosmic trends in metallicty, the ionizing ultraviolet background, and star formation, we conclude that galaxies eject more metal enriched gas, and therefore ${\MgII}$ absorbing gas, into their halos around $z = 2$ than at lower redshifts.

%============== INTRODUCTION =============================

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

One of the most important questions in modern studies of galactic evolution asks, how do baryons cycle into and out of galaxies, and how does this cycle determine the growth and evolution of galaxies themselves? More specifically, how does the process of gas accretion, star formation, and subsequent supernovae-driven feedback shape both the galaxies themselves and their circumgalactic medium (CGM)? By using spectroscopic observations of quasars, we can identify and analyze metal line absorbers in and around the halos of foreground galaxies. Though absorption line studies by themselves cannot directly answer these questions, the statistical results from such studies can provide vital information from which further progress can be made.

One of the most prolific absorption features, the {\MgIIdblt} doublet, traces cool ($T \simeq 10^4~\mathrm{K}$; \cite{Churchill2003}) metal enriched gas in the disks and halos of galaxies. It is one of the best tracers of this gas because it can exist in a wide range of ionizing conditions, ranging in ionization parameter from $-5 < \log U < 1$~\citep{Churchill1999}, it is observable in optical wavelengths for redshifts between $0.1 < z < 2.6$, and it has predictable line characteristics defined by its resonant doublet nature which make it ideal for automated searches. 

The origin of ${\MgII}$ absorbing gas is still debated. As summarized in~\cite{Kacprzak2011} and~\cite{Matejek2013}, two separate interpretations exist to explain the origin of strong ($W_r^{\lambda2796} > 0.3$~{\AA}) and weak ($W_r^{\lambda2796} < 0.3$~{\AA}) ${\MgII}$ absorbers. For the strong, higher equivalent width systems, multiple correlations exist between the rest frame ${\MgII}$ equivalent width around galaxies and the host galaxy's star formation properties. \cite{Zibetti2007}, \cite{Lundgren2009}, \cite{Noterdaeme2010}, \cite{Bordoloi2011}, and \cite{Nestor2011} all found a correlation betwen $W_r^{\lambda2796}$ and blue host galaxy color, showing that galaxies with more active star formation have more metal enriched gas in their halos. \cite{Bordoloi2014} also found that ${\MgII}$ equivalent width increases with increasing star formation rate density. In addition, down-the-barrel spectroscopic observations of star forming galaxies have revealed strong ${\MgII}$ absorption blueshifted $300 - 1000$~{\kms} relative to the host galaxy~\citep{Tremonti2007,Weiner2009,Martin2009,Rubin2010}. Finally, \cite{Bouche2006} found an anticorrelation between galaxy halo mass and ${\MgII}$ equivalent width, showing that individual clouds of a ${\MgII}$ system are not virialized in the halos of galaxies. They interpreted their results as a strong indication that high equivalent width absorbers with $W_r^{\lambda2796} \gtrsim 2$~{\AA} arise in galactic outflows.

For the weak, lower equivalent width systems, it seems none of the above correlations hold. \cite{Chen2010b}, \cite{Kacprzak2011}, and \cite{Lovegrove2011} found little evidence for a correlation between galaxy color and ${\MgII}$ equivalent width when restricting their samples to weak absorbers. \cite{Kacprzak2011} measured the orientation of galaxies relative to ${\MgII}$ detections in the sight lines of background quasars and identified co-planar gas around some galaxies, implying structures associated with accreting streams or filaments as opposed to outflows, which are more often observed perpendicular to the galaxy disk~\citep{Bordoloi2011,Kacprzak2012-PA}. Finally, the simulations of~\cite{Stewart2011} and~\cite{Ford2013mass} revealed a large reservoir of low-ionization, metal enriched, co-rotating gas around massive galaxies. Together, these studies paint a picture of the circumgalactic medium, as traced by ${\MgII}$, containing lower equivalent width systems tracing infalling gas and higher equivalent width systems tracing star formation driven outflows.

\cite{MAGIICAT1} constructed a sample of ${\MgII}$ absorbers and their associated galaxies and examined both strong and weak ${\MgII}$ absorbers from $0.07 \le z \le 1.1$. In the subsequent analysis of their sample,~\cite{MAGIICAT2} found a more extended ${\MgII}$ absorbing CGM around higher luminosity, bluer, higher redshift galaxies. In addition, in~\cite{MAGIICAT4}, they found that bluer galaxies replenish their ${\MgII}$ absorbing CGM through outflows, whereas red galaxies do not. Finally, in~\cite{MAGIICAT5}, it is made clear that the largest velocity dispersions in ${\MgII}$ absorbing systems are measured around blue, face-on galaxies probed along their minor axis, strongly suggesting that these ${\MgII}$ absorbers originate in bi-conical outflows.

Many surveys have been undertaken to inventory and examine the evolution of ${\MgII}$ absorbers. The earliest studies~\citep{Lanzetta1987,Tytler1987,Sargent1988,Steidel1992} found that ${\MgII}$ systems with rest equivalent widths above $0.3$~{\AA} show no evolution in $dN\!/dz$ between redshifts $0.2 < z < 2.15$. These studies also found that the equivalent width distribution function, $f(W_r^{\lambda2796})$, could be fit equally well with either an exponential or a power law function, leaving to question whether the cosmic distribution of ${\MgII}$ in galactic halos exhibited a fractal, self-similar nature, or if $f(W_r^{\lambda2796})$ flattens at equivalent widths below $W_r^{\lambda2796} < 0.3$~{\AA}.

${\MgII}$ absorption surveys have taken one of two different approaches to try to analyze the global distribution of ${\MgII}$ absorbing gas across cosmic time. \cite{Churchill1999} and \cite{Narayanan2007} aimed to determine more precisely how $dN\!/dz$ and $f(W_r^{\lambda2796})$ evolve with redshift by surveying weak ${\MgII}$ absorbers. They found that, for these low equivalent width absorbers, $dN\!/dz$ increases as a function of increasing redshift up until $z = 1.4$. At higher redshifts, $dN\!/dz$ falls to lower values, though the uncertainties are large. In addition, they found the equivalent width distribution function for weak absorbers is best fit by a power law, strongly disfavoring an exponential fit to the overall distribution. 

The most recent studies have employed new multi-object spectrographs such as the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and the FIRE spectrograph on the Magellan Baade Telescope~\citep{Nestor2005,Matejek2012}. \cite{Nestor2005}, who examined over 1300 intervening ${\MgII}$ absorbers in SDSS quasar spectra with $W_r^{\lambda2796} > 0.3$~{\AA}, found that the equivalent width distribution function is well fit by an exponential. They did not find evidence for redshift evolution in systems with $0.4 < W_r^{\lambda2796} < 2$~{\AA}, but observed an enhancement in the number of $W_r^{\lambda2796} > 2$~{\AA} absorbers per comoving redshift path length as a function of increasing redshift up to $z \sim 2$. \cite{Matejek2012}, analyzing 111 ${\MgII}$ absorbing systems from $1.9 < z < 6.3$ in infrared FIRE spectra, also found that the equivalent width distribution function is well fit by an exponential. They also observed that systems with $W_r^{\lambda2796} < 1.0$~{\AA} show no evolution with redshift, but higher equivalent width systems grow in number density from low redshift to $z \sim 3$, after which the number density declines.

Collectively, these surveys imply physical changes in the astrophysical processes or in the state of the gas structures in the environments giving rise to ${\MgII}$ absorption as the universe ages. The properties of a given ${\MgII}$ absorbing cloud are governed by the total amount of gas present, the gas phase metallicity, and the nature of the background radiation incident on the cloud.

As shown by~\cite{Quiret2016}, studying a large sample of damped Ly$\alpha$ absorbers (DLAs; neutral hydrogen absorbers with $\log(N(\mathrm{HI})) > 20.3$) and sub-DLAs ($19.0~\mathrm{cm^{-2}} < \log(N(\mathrm{HI})) < 20.3~\mathrm{cm^{-2}}$), the average metallicity of the circumgalactic medium decreases from $z = 0$ to $z = 5$. In addition,~\cite{Menard2009} show that a correlation exists between the neutral hydrogen column density of an absorber and the rest frame ${\MgII}$ equivalent width, with stronger ${\MgII}$ absorbing systems having large $N(\mathrm{HI})$. As ${\MgII}$ absorbers are often found associated with nearby galaxies, one can infer that the metallicity evolution of DLA's and sub-DLA's should be reflected in the evolution of ${\MgII}$ absorbing systems~\citep{Kulkarni2002,Prochaska2003,Kulkarni2005,Kulkarni2007}. 

%Finally, multiple studies have shown that ${\MgII}$ absorption is observed primarily around galaxies within a projected radius of $\sim100~\mathrm{kpc}$. 

%using detailed radiative transfer models, synthesized the intensity and shape of the diffuse cosmic UV/X-ray background. They\

The cosmic ionizing background also changes dramatically from $z = 0$ to $z = 2.5$. \cite{Haardt2012} showed that the slope and intensity of the diffuse UV/X-ray ionizing background increase as redshift increases, with a harder, more intense ionizing background present at higher redshift. Specifically, the comoving 1 Rydberg emissivity increases from $\sim2 \times 10^{23}~\mathrm{erg~s^{-1}~Mpc^{-3}~Hz^{-1}}$ at $z = 0$ to $\sim70 \times 10^{23}~\mathrm{erg~s^{-1}~Mpc^{-3}~Hz^{-1}}$ at $z = 2.5$. ${\MgII}$ absorbers are subject primarily to this UV background, with very little contribution from stellar radiation from a nearby galaxy~\citep{Churchill1999,Charlton2000,Rigby2002}.

\cite{Behroozi2013sfr} showed that the cosmic star formation rate peaks around $z \sim 2$. At this point in time, galaxies are on average forming stars at a rate ten times greater than at $z = 0$. In conjunction with the fact that galactic-scale outflows can be driven by star formation~\citep{Zhu2015}, and these outflows can eject ${\MgII}$ absorbing gas to large galactocentric radii~\citep{Sharma2013,Kacprzak2012-PA,Nestor2011}, it follows that more metal enriched gas, traced by ${\MgII}$ absorbers, should be driven out of galaxies at $z \sim 2$. One goal of The Vulture Survey is to find and analyze definitive observational signatures of this energetic epoch. 

We now aim to better understand the complex relationship between absorbing gas in the CGM/IGM and the physical processes shaping galaxy formation as the universe ages. For our survey, we will analyze the largest, most comprehensive sample of high resolution, high signal-to-noise quasar spectra to uniformly observe both strong and weak ${\MgII}$ absorbers. We hope to finally bridge the equivalent width dichotomy in prior ${\MgII}$ absorption line surveys by analyzing large numbers of both strong and weak absorbers. To do so, we will examine quasar spectra observed with either the VLT/UVES~\citep{Dekker2000} or Keck/HIRES~\citep{Vogt1994} spectrographs. We aim to characterize the evolution in the number density of all ${\MgII}$ absorbers from present to beyond the peak of the cosmic star formation rate. We interpret these results in the context of global evolution in metallicity around galaxies, the ionizing background, and cosmic star formation.

We begin by explaining the methods of acquiring and analyzing the quasar spectra in Section~\ref{sec:data}. In Section~\ref{sec:results}, we present the results showing the evolution of the ${\MgII}$ equivalent width distribution, $dN\!/dX$, and the ${\MgII}$ column density distribution across redshift. We also analyze the functional fit to both the equivalent width and column density distributions. In Section~\ref{sec:discussion} we discuss the redshift evolution of all types of ${\MgII}$ absorbers and derive the relative matter density contributed to the universe by {\MgII}, $\Omega_{\MgII}$. In Section~\ref{sec:conclusions} we summarize our results and look to future studies using this rich data set, including a companion analysis of intervening {\CIV} absorbers and detailed kinematic analysis of intervening absorbing systems. For all calculations, we adopt the most recently published Planck cosmology, with $H_0 = 67.81~\mathrm{km~s^{-1}~Mpc}$, $\Omega_M = 0.308$, and $\Omega_{\Lambda} = 0.692$~\citep{Planck2016}.

%============== SAMPLE DESCRIPTION, DATA, ANALYSIS =======================

\section{Data and Analysis}
\label{sec:data}

\subsection{Quasar Spectra Sample}

We have assembled a sample of 602 archival quasar spectra observed with the VLT/UVES and Keck/HIRES spectrographs. The data originate from two archival data mining efforts - the UVES SQUAD collaboration (432 spectra) led by Michael Murphy, and the KODIAQ Survey (170 spectra) led by John O'Meara \citep{OMeara2015}. The spectra range in signal to noise from $4$ to $288$ per pixel, with the mean $S\,/N = 38$ per pixel. Quasar emission redshifts span $0.014 < z < 5.292$. Wavelength coverage for each spectrum varies based upon the settings used for each spectrograph. VLT/UVES has 3 CCD chips available, offering large wavelength coverage from $\sim 3000$ to $\sim10\,000$~{\AA}. However, wavelength coverage available for each quasar spectum varies based upon the selected cross-disperser settings. The exposures used from Keck/HIRES were taken from 2004 to present, when a 3 chip CCD mosiac was installed, also allowing wavelength coverage from  $\sim 3000$ to $\sim10\,000$~{\AA}. Again, though, individual quasar observations vary in wavelength coverage based upon cross-disperser angle. We detect 1180 ${\MgII}$ absorbing systems from $0.14 < z < 2.64$ to a detection limit of $W_r^{\lambda2796} \simeq 0.02$~{\AA} at $100\%$ completeness for regions with $S/N > 40$ per pixel.

\label{fig:bias}
\end{figure*}

The archival quasar spectra used to construct the Vulture survey were observed for a multitude of reasons. In cases where observations were taken to target a previously known absorption line system, these detections could bias our sample when calculating $dN\!/dz$ and $dN\!/dX$. Because early studies which discovered ${\MgII}$ absorbers did not have the sensitivity to detect weak, low equivalent width systems, quasar spectra were never selected based upon the presence of weak absorption. However, some spectra were selected based on the presence of strong, $W_r^{\lambda2796} > 0.3$~{\AA} systems. In order to properly quantify any bias, we compare our work to the massive, unbiased sample of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). Specifically, we turn to the work of~\cite{Nestor2005} who inventoried strong ${\MgII}$ absorbers in SDSS quasar spectra. In~\cite{Nestor2005}, the authors constructed the equivalent width frequency distribution for absorbers with $W_r^{\lambda2796} > 0.3$~{\AA} and found the best fit to this distribution was an exponential function of the form,

\begin{equation}
f(W_r^{\lambda2796}) = \frac{N^*}{W^*} e^{-\,\left(W_r^{\lambda2796} / W^*\right)}
\label{eqn:exponential}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $N^*$ and $W^*$ are constants. In order to compare to the SDSS data, we limit our sample to absorbers with equivalent widths $W_r^{\lambda2796} > 0.3$~{\AA} and calculate the equivalent width frequency distribution. In the left panel of Figure~\ref{fig:bias}, we show $f(W_r^{\lambda2796})$ for the Vulture survey and an exponential fit to our data, along with the exponential fit of~\cite{Nestor2005}. \cite{Nestor2005} found the best-fit parameters to be $N^* = 1.187 \pm 0.052$ and $W^* = 0.702 \pm 0.-17$. When we perform the same analysis, fitting Equation~\ref{eqn:exponential} to the Vulture survey data, we derive $N^* = 1.39 \pm 0.10$ and $W^* = 0.74 \pm 0.05$. By eye, there appears a slight excess in the number of ${\MgII}$ absorbers above $W_r^{\lambda2796} > 3$~{\AA}.

In order to statistically determine the bias in our sample, we perform a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test to quantitatively measure the similarity between our sample of absorbers with $W_r^{\lambda2796} > 0.3$~{\AA} and the exponential fit of~\cite{Nestor2005}. In the right panel of Figure~\ref{fig:bias}, we show the cumulative distribution of the strong absorbers in the Vulture survey in black, along with the exponential fits to our data and the fits of~\cite{Nestor2005}. P(K-S) is the probability that the two samples are drawn from different underlying distributions. Our criterion to assert that our sample is not inconsistent with an unbiased sample requires P(K-S)$\, > 0.0027$, which means that it could not be ruled out at the $3\sigma$ level that the two populations are consistent with one another. With P(K-S)$\, = 0.114$, we conclude that our sample is not inconsistent with an unbiased sample, even at the $2\sigma$ level, and that the strong absorbers in the Vulture survey could very well have originated from the same underlying population as the unbiased SDSS quasar spectra sample.

% ============== Continuum Fitting and Line Detection ======================================

\subsection{Data Reduction and Line Detection}
\label{sec:detection}

The KODIAQ data sample is reduced and fully continuum fit, delivered as normalized spectra according to the prescriptions of \cite{OMeara2015}. To summarize, observing runs are grouped together and uniformly reduced using HIRedux\footnote{http://www.ucolick.org/~xavier/HIRedux/} as part of the XIDL\footnote{http://www.ucolick.org/~xavier/IDL/index.html} suite of astronomical routines in IDL. Continuum fits are applied one order at a time using Legendre polynomials by a single member of KODIAQ team, John O'Meara, to minimize bias and variation. 

The UVES SQUAD sample also comes reduced and continuum fit according to the prescriptions of~\cite{King2012,Bagdonaite2014,Murphy2016,Murphyprep}. Reduction was carried out using the ESO Common Pipeline Language data-reduction software.\footnote{http://www.eso.org/observing/dfo/quality/UVES/pipeline/pipe\_reduc.html} The continuum is fit automatically with a low order polynomial in small sections using UVES\_popler, an ESO/VLT UVES post-pipeline echelle reduction program written by Michael T. Murphy~\citep{MurphyPOPLER}. This fit can incorrectly estimate the continuum around narrow emission regions and broad absorption features. Using UVES\_popler, we add a higher order continuum fit to such regions of each spectrum, always preserving the continuity of the continuum with non-absorbing regions. 

The next step involves detecting all ${\MgII}$ absorption features. We first limit the search range to regions of the spectrum redward of the {\Lya} emission, as {\Lya} forest contamination would render automatic detection of weaker metal lines nearly impossible. We also do not search $5000$~{\kms} blueward of the quasar emission redshift in order to avoid absorbers associated with the quasar itself. Finally, we exclude regions of strong telluric absorption bands, specifically from $6277 - 6318$~{\AA}, $6868 - 6932$~{\AA}, $7594 - 7700$~{\AA}, and $9300 - 9630$~{\AA}, because we found that the molecular line separations and ratios can lead to numerous false positives when searching for ${\MgII}$ doublets. 

To find all intervening {\MgIIdblt} absorbers, we employ a techinque outlined in \cite{Zhu2013}, in which we perform a matched filter search for absorption candidates detected above a certain signal-to-noise (S/N) threshold. The filter is a top hat function centered at the wavelength of the desired redshifted absorption line. Its width is selected to match the resolution of the spectrum, which is a function of the slit width used during the exposure. A large variety of slit-widths can be used, but, characteristically for a 1.0 arcsec slit, $R \sim 40,000$ for VLT/UVES and $R \sim 45,000$ for Keck/HIRES. We convolve the filter with the normalized spectrum to generate a normalized power spectrum in redshift space, with absorption features having positive power. 

% STOPPED MURPHY EDITS HERE ============================================================================

The error spectrum in both instruments is complex, irregular, and has frequent single-pixel spikes which makes uniform normalization impossible. Therefore, we cannot convolve the filter with the error spectrum to derive normalized noise estimates, as is often done in matched filter analysis. Instead, we examine the noise in the derived power spectrum. To derive the noise, we first sigma-clip chunks of the power spectrum to remove absorption features, leaving only the continuum power spectrum. Next, we calculate the standard deviation of this continuum. Finally, we use the standard deviation as the noise to calculate the signal-to-noise of the absorption features in the power spectrum as the ratio of the normalized power ($S$) to the normalized noise ($N$). A flagged absorption feature has $S/N > 5$. A confirmed doublet detetection for {\MgIIdblt} requires detection of $S/N^{\lambda2796} > 5$ and $S/N^{\lambda2803} > 3$. In addition, our automated routines remove detections with non-physical doublet ratios in unsaturated regions; specifically, we exclude cases where $W_r^{\lambda2803} > W_r^{\lambda2796}$, or $W_r^{\lambda2803} < \left(0.3 \times W_r^{\lambda2796}\right)$. The latter constraint is conservative for unsaturated ${\MgII}$ absorbers, as $W_r^{\lambda2803}$ is rarely observed less than $0.5 \times W_r^{\lambda2796}$. We relax this constraint in saturated features. 

All absorption features are visually verified upon completion of the detection algorithm. Multiple feature detections within $\pm 500$~{\kms} of each other are grouped together to generate absorption systems, designated as a single absorber, to be analyzed. Once absorption systems are identified, we calculate the optical depth-weighted median absorption redshift to define the center of the entire absorption system. The formal derivation of this redshift is described in the appendix of~\cite{Churchill2001}.

% *** MURPHY doesn't understand this optical-depth-weighted median. 

We also derive an equivalent width detection limit across the spectrum. To do so, we model Gaussian features across the spectrum and assume a full-width at half maximum (FWHM) defined by the resolution of the instrument to represent unresolved lines. We then solve for the height of the Gaussian, defined as the value at the curve's peak, required to detect the unresolved line with our matched filtering technique at a $S/N = 5$. Finally, we integrate to find the equivalent width, and take that value as the minimum detectable equivalent width at a given wavelength. The detection algorithm is therefore self-monitoring. This full equivalent width detection limit spectrum also allows us to accurately characterize the completeness of our sample, along with the full redshift path length searched. 

% ============== Measuring Absorption Properties ======================================

\subsection{Measuring Absorption Properties}
\label{sec:measuring}

For each absorption system, we automatically define the wavelength bounds of an absorbing region by finding where the flux recovers to within $1\sigma$ of the continuum, with $\sigma$ defined by the error spectrum, for three pixels on either side of the absorption trough. Within these regions we calculate rest-frame equivalent widths ($W_r$), velocity widths ($\Delta v$), kinematic spreads ($\omega_v$), apparent optical depth (AOD) column densities ($\log(N)$), and absorption asymmetries. The functional forms of these parameters are detailed in the appendix of~\cite{Churchill2001}, equations$~\mathrm{A3 - A7}$.

\caption{Correlations between measured absorption properties for the Vulture survey. $\log N$ is the ${\MgII}$ AOD column density, $\omega_v$ is the kinematic spread, $W_r^{2796}$ is the rest frame {\MgII2796} equivalent width, and $z$ is the absorption redshift.}
\label{fig:scatterplots}
\end{figure*}

Figure~\ref{fig:scatterplots} shows the relationships between the measured absorption parameters, characterizing the distribution of absorption properties for our survey. With redshift, there are no obvious trends other than the highest equivalent width absorbers, with $W_r^{2796} > 4$~{\AA}, existing at $z > 1.5$. The data gaps at $z = 1.7$ and $z = 2.4$ represent the larger omitted search regions which overlap with the stronger telluric absorption bands. With column density, we see the normal trends of higher column density systems exhibiting higher equivalent widths and velocity spreads, with the distributions asymptoting near $\log N \simeq 15~\mathrm{cm^{-2}}$ due to saturation effects and the nature of measuring column densities with the AOD method. With respect to kinematic spread, we observe the saturation line in the $\omega_v$ vs. $W_r^{2796}$ relationship, showing the maximum $\omega_v$ for a flat-bottomed absorption profile of a given equivalent width.

\subsection{Sample Completeness and Survey Path Coverage}

\caption{The function $g(W_r^{\lambda2796}, z)$ shown as a heat map with the colors representing the value of $g(W_r^{2796}, z)$. This is the number of spectra in which an absorption line of a given equivalent width and a given redshift may be detected according to the detection limit of the spectrum. The vertical black bars representing no redshift path length coverage show the omitted wavelength regions of the survey based upon contaminating telluric absorption features.}
\label{fig:gwz}
\end{figure*}

To evaluate the completeness and calculate the redshift path coverage of our survey, we use the derived $5\sigma$ equivalent width detection limit described at the end of Section~\ref{sec:detection} to determine the number of spectra in which we could detect an absorber of a given equivalent width and redshift. Figure~\ref{fig:gwz} shows the function $g(W_r^{\lambda2796}, z)$, defined as

\begin{equation}
g(W_j,z_k) = \sum_n H(z_k - z_n^{\mathrm{min}}) H(z_n^{\mathrm{max}} - z_k) H[W_j - 5\sigma_k / (1 + z_k)],
\label{eqn:gwz}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $H$ is the Heaviside step function, $z_n^{\mathrm{min}}$ and $z_n^{\mathrm{max}}$ are the minimum and maximum redshifts observed for the $n$th quasar spectrum, and where the sum extends over all quasar spectra in the sample. This heat map details the number of spectra in which a {\MgIIdblt} doublet could be detected as a function of the equivalent width detection limit and redshift. The vertical stripes with no redshift path coverage represent the omitted telluric absorption regions for our survey. The integral along a given $W_r^{2796}$ slice gives the total redshift path length available for the sample ($\Delta Z$).

% ================ dN\!/dz + dN\!/dX ================
\subsection{$dN\!/dz$ and $dN\!/dX$}
\label{dndzdndx}

The largest sample of quasar spectra originates from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), with more than $10^5$ spectra at present, which employs a spectrograph with an instrumental resolution around $69$~{\kms}, limiting SDSS absorption surveys to strong absorbers, with $W_r^{\lambda2796} \ge 0.3$~{\AA} \citep{Nestor2005,Zhu2013}. Conversely, previous studies of weak absorbers used small samples of quasar spectra, never exceeding 100 quasar spectra \citep{Steidel1992,Narayanan2007,Kacprzak2011}. In this paper, we aim to characterize the evolution of the incidence rate, number of absorbers per redshift path length, comoving line density, and cosmic mass density of all ${\MgII}$ absorbers from redshifts $0.18 < z < 2.57$.

The number of ${\MgII}$ absorbers per redshift path length and its associated variance are defined as

\begin{equation}
\frac{d N}{d z} = \sum_{i}\frac{1}{\Delta Z_i\,(W_r)},\quad \sigma^2_{\frac{d N}{d Z}} = \sum_{i} \Big[\frac{1}{\Delta Z_i\,(W_r)}\Big]^2,
\label{eqn:dndz}
\end{equation}

\noindent
where we count the number of ${\MgII}$ absorbers, dividing by the total searched redshift path length ($\Delta Z$), defined as

\begin{equation}
\Delta Z_i\,(W_r) = \int_{z_1}^{z_2} g_i\,(W_r, z)\,dz,
\label{eqn:deltaz}
\end{equation}

\noindent
where $g_i(W_r, z)$ is the equivalent width sensitivity function at a given equivalent width detection limit shown in Equation~\ref{eqn:gwz}. The function $g(W_r, z)$, first formulated in \cite{Lanzetta1987}, details the number of spectra in which a given equivalent width absorption feature may be detected at the $5\sigma$ level in a given redshift interval. 

The comoving ${\MgII}$ line density and its associated variance are defined as

\begin{equation}
\frac{d N}{d X} = \sum_{i}\frac{1}{\Delta X_i\,(W_r)},\quad \sigma^2_{\frac{d N}{d z}} = \sum_{i} \Big[\frac{1}{\Delta X_i\,(W_r)}\Big]^2,
\label{eqn:dndx}
\end{equation}

\noindent
where we count the number of ${\MgII}$ absorbers, dividing by the total searched absorption path ($\Delta X$), defined as

\begin{equation}
\Delta X_i\,(W_r) = \int_{z_1}^{z_2} g_i\,(W_r, z) \frac{(1 + z)^2}{\sqrt{\Omega_M (1 + z)^3 + \Omega_{\Lambda}}}\,dz,
\label{eqn:deltax}
\end{equation}

\noindent
where $\Omega_M$ is the cosmic matter density, and $\Omega_{\Lambda}$ is the cosmic density attributed to dark energy. Counting with respect to $\Delta X$ accounts for both cosmological expansion along the line of sight and the transverse separation of objects with unchanging number density and cross section, allowing for more consistent comparisons across redshifts.

\label{fig:dndz_dndx}
\end{figure*}

In Figure~\ref{fig:dndz_dndx}, we plot $dN\!/dz$ and $dN\!/dX$, respectively, as a function of redshift for different minimum equivalent width thresholds, such that detected ${\MgII}$ absorbers have equivalent widths greater than $W_{r,\mathrm{min}}^{\lambda2796}$.  Dotted lines are fit according to the analytical form which allows for redshift evolution in $dN\!/dX$, defined as,

\begin{equation}
f(z) \equiv  \frac{c}{H_o} n(z)\,\sigma(z) =  \frac{c}{H_o} n_0\,\sigma_0\,(1+z)^{\epsilon},
\label{eqn:dndxfit}
\end{equation}

\noindent
where $c$ is the speed of light, $H_o$ is the Hubble Constant, $n_0$ is the comoving number density of ${\MgII}$ absorbers at $z = 0$, $\sigma_0$ is the absorbing cross-section at $z = 0$, and $\epsilon$ is the evolution parameter, defined as the power dependence of $dN\!/dX$ on redshift. The product $n_0\,\sigma_0$ represents a comoving opacity of absorption line systems by virtue of the units ($\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$) and the analogous absorption coefficient to describe the opacity of material in stellar atmospheres. We find that the best-fit value of $\epsilon$ is negative when analyzing the full sample of ${\MgII}$ absorbers, including all detections with measured equivalent widths above $W_r^{\lambda2796} > 0.01$~{\AA}. The evolution parameter, $\epsilon$, then increases with subsequently larger minimum equivalent width thresholds, becoming positive for absorbers with $W_{r,\mathrm{min}}^{\lambda2796}$. This trend is driven primarily by an enhancement in $dN\!/dX$ for the strongest ${\MgII}$ absorbers around $z \sim 2$, relative to lower redshifts. Conversely, at low redshift we observe more weak ${\MgII}$ absorbers per absorption path length. We show in Table~\ref{tab:fitparams} the values of the fit parameters for varying $W_{r,\mathrm{min}}^{\lambda2796}$, along with their errors.

\caption{Left: The comoving number density of absorbers multiplied by the absorbing cross-section, derived by fitting Equation~\ref{eqn:dndxfit} to $dN\!/dX$, as a function of $W_{r,\mathrm{min}}^{\lambda2796}$. As we examine samples with increasing minimum ${\MgII}$ equivalent width thresholds, either the space density of absorbing cloud structures decreases, the absorbing cross-section decreases, or both parameters decrease. Right: The redshift evolution parameter, $\epsilon$, as a function of $W_{r,\mathrm{min}}^{\lambda2796}$. Weak ${\MgII}$ absorbers are more abundant at low redshift, leading to a negative coefficient $\epsilon$. Absorbers with equivalent widths near $0.3$~{\AA} do not evolve, with $\epsilon \simeq 0$. Strong ${\MgII}$ absorbers evolve away at low redshift, showing a large positive $\epsilon$ increasing towards $z \sim 2$.}
\label{fig:nsigmaepsilon}
\end{figure*}

In Figure~\ref{fig:nsigmaepsilon}, we show the values of $n_0\,\sigma_0$ and $\epsilon$ as a function of $W_{r,\mathrm{min}}^{\lambda2796}$. The shaded red areas represent the $1\sigma$ standard deviations derived from the fits to the $dN\!/dX$ distribution. We show first that the comoving opacity of ${\MgII}$ absorbers decreases as a function of $W_r^{\lambda2796}$. This implies that there are fewer high equivalent width ${\MgII}$ absorbers, and/or that they exist in smaller absorbing structures. We also show that the slope of the redshift dependence, $\epsilon$, increases as a function of $W_{r,\mathrm{min}}^{\lambda2796}$. This evolution parameter, $\epsilon$, changes from negative to positive toward higher equivalent width ${\MgII}$ absorbers, implying that strong ${\MgII}$ absorbers evolve away, decreasing in relative number per absorption path length, from $z = 2$ to present, and that weak ${\MgII}$ absorbers preferentially take their place. We observe no evolution with redshift in absorbers with equivalent widths between $0.2 < W_r^{\lambda2796} < 1$~{\AA}.

We also fit $\frac{c}{H_o}\,n_0\,\sigma_0$ and $\epsilon$ as a function of $W_{r,\mathrm{min}}^{\lambda2796}$. In the left panel of Figure~\ref{fig:nsigmaepsilon}, we fit a Schechter-like function to the $\frac{c}{H_o}\,n_0\,\sigma_0$ distribution, defined as,

\begin{equation}
\frac{c}{H_o}n_0\,\sigma_0\,(\,\psi\,) = \Psi^* (\,\psi\,)^{\alpha} e^{-\,\psi\,^{\beta}} ,
\label{eqn:nsigmafit}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $\psi = \frac{W_{r,\mathrm{min}}^{\lambda2796}}{W_{r,\mathrm{min}}^*}$ to simplify the equation. The best fit parameters are $\Psi^* = 0.24 \pm 0.01$, $W_{r,\mathrm{min}}^* = 1.19 \pm 0.02$, $\alpha = -0.49 \pm 0.01$, and $\beta = 1.50 \pm 0.05$. This parameterization resembles a Schechter function, but we required an exponential drop-off at the high end faster than $e^x$, which manifests itself in the form of $\beta$. Next, in the right panel of Figure~\ref{fig:nsigmaepsilon}, we fit a broken power law to the $\epsilon$ distribution, defined as,

\[
\epsilon\,(W_{r,\mathrm{min}}^{\lambda2796}) =
\left\{

%3.64\,(W_{r,\mathrm{min}}^{\lambda2796})^{0.08}\, -\, 3.44 &\,\, \text{ if }\,\, W_{r,\mathrm{min}}^{\lambda2796} < 1.1~{\angstrom} \\[2mm]

\label{eqn:epsilonfit}
\end{aligned}
\right.
\]

\noindent where the fit parameters for minimum equivalent width thresholds below $1.1$~{\AA} are $a_1 = 3.13 \pm 1.49$, $\gamma_1 = 0.09 \pm 0.05$, and $b_1 = 2.87 \pm 1.49$. The fit parameters for the power law with $W_{r,\mathrm{min}}^{\lambda2796} \ge 1.1$~{\AA} are $a_2 = 0.07 \pm 0.01$, $\gamma_2 = 3.73 \pm 0.25$, and $b_2 = -0.21 \pm 0.03$. Combining the fits to $\frac{c}{H_o}\,n_0\,\sigma_0$ and $\epsilon$, we now have an analytic parameterization of $dN\!/dX$ as a function of $W_{r,\mathrm{min}}^{\lambda2796}$, and $z$, of the form,

\begin{equation}
\frac{dN}{dX}(W_{r,\mathrm{min}}^{\lambda2796}, z) = \Psi^* \psi^{\alpha} e^{-\psi^{\beta}} (1 + z)^{\epsilon(W_{r,\mathrm{min}}^{\lambda2796})}.
\label{eqn:dndxanalytic}
\end{equation} 

\noindent This function can be used in future semi-analytic models to parameterize the physical properties of ${\MgII}$ absorbers in galaxy halos (e.g.~\cite{Shattow2015}).

\subsection{Equivalent Width Frequency Distribution}
\label{sec:ewdistro}

To calculate the equivalent width frequency distribution $f(W)$, the number of absorbers of a given equivalent width per unit path density, we calculate $dN\!/dz$ or $dN\!/dX$ for each equivalent width bin and divide by the bin width. We split the sample into four redshift regimes, ensuring that the number of absorbers in each redshift subsample remains constant. The result is a characteristic number of ${\MgII}$ absorbers per redshift or absorption path length per equivalent width.

\begin{figure*}[bth]
\epsscale{1.17}
\plottwo{PLOTS/hist_ew_MgII_dndz.pdf}{PLOTS/hist_ew_MgII_dndx.pdf}
\caption{Left: The equivalent width distribution of ${\MgII}$ absorbers, defined as the redshift path density ($dN\!/dz$) in each equivalent width bin divided by the bin width. Right: The equivalent width distribution, defined as the comoving line density ($dN\!/dX$) in each equivalent width bin divided by the bin width. We fit each distribution with a Schechter function, capturing the self-similar power law behavior of weak ${\MgII}$ absorbers and the exponential power law cutoff when observing the strongest ${\MgII}$ systems.}
\label{fig:ewdistro}
\end{figure*}

In Figure~\ref{fig:ewdistro}, we plot the equivalent width frequency distribution with respect to either $dN\!/dz$ or $dN\!/dX$. We fit each distribution with a Schechter function of the form,

\begin{equation}
\Phi (W_r) = \Phi^* \left(\frac{W_r}{W_r^*}\right)^{\alpha} e^{-W_r / W_r^*} ,
\label{eqn:schechter}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $\Phi^*$ is the normalization, $\alpha$ is the low equivalent width power-law slope, and $W_r^*$ is the turnover point in the distribution where the low equivalent width power law slope transitions into an exponential cutoff. Table~\ref{tab:schechterew} shows the values of $\Phi^*$, $W_r^*$, and $\alpha$, along with their associated $1\sigma$ uncertainties. This functional fit is motivated by papers such as \cite{Kacprzak2011MgII}, where the authors seek to combine previous surveys of strong ${\MgII}$ absorbers, in which exponential fits were preferred, and surveys of weak ${\MgII}$ absorbers, where power laws best fit the equivalent width distribution. The power law nature of the distribution of weak absorbers in our survey is apparent, and the exponential cutoff is motivated by physical limits to the size, density, and velocity widths of ${\MgII}$ absorbing clouds. Examining the distribution as a function of redshift, we find the low equivalent width slope becomes more shallow at $z \sim 2$ compared with the present epoch, with $\alpha = -1.09$ in our subsample with $0.14 \le z < 0.78$ and $\alpha = -0.81$ in our subsample with $1.53 < z \le 2.64$. We observe fewer weak ${\MgII}$ absorbers and more strong ${\MgII}$ absorbers per redshift/comoving absorption path length at $z \sim 2$ than we do at $z \sim 0.5$.

% As shown in Table 2, alpha is approximately -1 and then it changes drastically at z = 2 with $\alpha \sim 0.8$

\subsection{Column Density Distribution}
\label{sec:logndistro}

To calculate the column density distribution, the number of absorbers of a given column density per unit path density, we calculate $dN\!/dz$ or $dN\!/dX$ for each column density bin and divide by the bin width. The result is a characteristic number density of ${\MgII}$ absorbers per redshift or absorption path length as a function of their column densities. It should be noted that at high column densities near $\log (N({\MgII})) = 15~\mathrm{cm^{-2}}$, the measured column densities are lower limits as the AOD method cannot constrain the true column when the absorption line becomes saturated.

Right: The comoving line density ($dN\!/dX$) in each column density bin divided by the bin width. We fit this distribution with a Schechter function to accurately parameterize the low column density power law slope and the exponential cutoff and high column densities.}
\label{fig:logndistro}
\end{figure*}

In Figure~\ref{fig:logndistro}, we plot the column density frequency distribution using either $dN\!/dz$ or $dN\!/dX$. Again, we fit this distribution with a Schechter function of the same form as Equation~\ref{eqn:schechter}, except with equivalent width replaced with column density. Table~\ref{tab:schechtern} shows the values of $\Phi^*$, $N^*$, and $\alpha$, along with their associated errors. We find again that the low column density slope is shallower near $z \sim 2$ than at $z \sim 0.5$. Due to saturation effects, the highest column density measurements are lower limits; therefore, the final high column density bin in $f(N)$ is best regarded as an upper limit. These limits are taken into account in our functional fitting procedures.

\section{Discussion}
\label{sec:discussion}

We have shown a full cosmic inventory of ${\MgII}$ absorbing gas from $0.1 < z < 2.6$, measuring $dN\!/dz$, $dN\!/dX$, the equivalent width distribution, and the column density distribution down to detection limits as low as $W_r^{\lambda2796} = 0.01$~{\AA}. We aim now to relate the properties of ${\MgII}$ absorbers and the evolution of these properties across cosmic time to other known evolutionary processes with the hope of gaining insight into the mechanisms which give rise to ${\MgII}$ absorbing gas.

Parameterizing $dN\!/dX$ as a function of minimum equivalent width threshold, where we consider all absorbers with rest frame equivalent widths above a given $W_{r,\mathrm{min}}^{\lambda2796}$, we find that the comoving opacity of ${\MgII}$ absorbers, $n_0\,\sigma_0$ follows a modified Schechter function. In addition, the redshift evolution parameter, $\epsilon$, is best fit with a proken power-law as a function of $W_{r,\mathrm{min}}^{\lambda2796}$. When combined, these parameters provide an analytic solution to $dN\!/dX$ as a function of $W_{r,\mathrm{min}}^{\lambda2796}$ and $z$. We hope to provide a useful addition to future semi-analytic models, such as~\cite{Shattow2015}, and a strong constraint on future simulations which attempt to recreate the properties of metal absorbers across cosmic time.

\subsection{Evolution of ${\MgII}$ Distributions}

\cite{Narayanan2007} measured the evolution of weak ${\MgII}$ absorbers from $0.4 < z < 2.4$ in VLT/UVES spectra. They compared to \cite{Churchill1999}, who fitted the equivalent width frequency distribution with a power-law, and to \cite{Nestor2005}, who fitted an exponential to $f(W_r)$. In the case of weak absorbers at $z < 1.4$, \cite{Narayanan2007} found that a power-law with a slope of $\alpha = -1.04$ is a satisfactory fit, mirroring the results of \cite{Churchill1999}. When they split their sample into low redshift, with detections between $0.4 < z < 1.4$, and high redshift, with detections between $1.4 < z < 2.4$, they found that the low redshfit sample remained consistent with a power-law but the high redshift sample was best fit by an exponential function. Our data show that a faint end power law slope of $\alpha = -0.81$ is appropriate for the higher redshift subsample, and we note that this is also consistent with the data of~\cite{Narayanan2007}.

\begin{figure}[bth]

This equivalent width range comprises exclusively ``weak'' ${\MgII}$ absorbers. These weak systems evolve away towards $z = 2$.}
\label{fig:dndzbetween}
\end{figure}

\cite{Narayanan2007} also analyzed the evolution of $dN\!/dz$ with redshift for weak ${\MgII}$ absorbers. They found that the distribution follows the ``no evolution'' expectation; that is, the expected number density for a nonevolving population of absorbers in a $\mathrm{\Lambda CDM}$ universe, at redshifts less than $z = 1.5$. At higher redshift, they found that $dN\!/dz$ for weak absorbers is much lower, deviating from the ``no evolution'' expectation. In the top panel of Figure~\ref{fig:dndzbetween} we make a direct comparison with \cite{Narayanan2007}, showing $dN\!/dz$ for $0.02 \le W_r^{\lambda2796} < 0.3$~{\AA} binned in the same manner as their Figure 4. Here, we observe that the apparent peak in $dN\!/dz$ for weak absorbers occurs near $z = 0.75$, as opposed to $z = 1.2$ in \cite{Narayanan2007}. However, the overall shape of $dN\!/dz$ for this low equivalent width population remains in good agreement, with the number of weak absorbers per redshift path length increasing from $z = 0.4$ to $z \sim 1.0$, and then decreasing from $z \sim 1.0$ to $z \sim 2.4$. In the bottom panel of Figure~\ref{fig:dndzbetween}, we show $dN\!/dX$ for weak ${\MgII}$ absorbers. Here, we clearly see evolution in the distribution of low equivalent width absorbers, showing that the comoving line density of weak ${\MgII}$ absorbers steadily decreases as a function of redshift from $z = 0.4$ to $z = 2.4$. The ``no evolution'' assumption would be a perfectly flat distribution. 

\cite{Steidel1992}, and later \cite{Nestor2005}, examined the redshift evolution of $dN\!/dz$ for strong ${\MgII}$ absorbers with $W_r^{\lambda2796} > 0.3$~{\AA}. They found that the number of strong ${\MgII}$ absorbers per redshift path length increases as a function of redshift from $z = 0$ to $z = 2.2$; however, they could not derive the slope of this trend to sufficient accuracy to distinguish between an evolving population or a non-evolving population. We perform a similar analysis on our sample, calculating instead $dN\!/dX$, where a flat distribution implies no evolution. When we take absorbers with $W_r^{\lambda2796} > 0.3$~{\AA}, we find that a fit to the function $dN\,/dX = \frac{c}{H_o}n_0\,\sigma_0(1+z)^{\epsilon}$ with a slope of $\epsilon = -0.20 \pm 0.22$ is appropriate, implying that the comoving number density and/or cross-section of strong ${\MgII}$ absorbers does not significantly evolve. However, when considering even stronger absorbers with $W_r^{\lambda2796} > 1$~{\AA}, we do observe evolution in $dN\!/dX$, with the evolution parameter, $\epsilon$, becomming positive and increasing, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:nsigmaepsilon}. This evolution could be influenced by either an increase in the cosmic metallicity, a decrease in the ionizing background, or an increase in the total quantity of ${\MgII}$ absorbing gas outside galaxies. In Section~\ref{sec:trendcauses}, we will explore the physical processes responsible for evolution in the universal distribution of ${\MgII}$ absorbing gas.

\label{fig:totalewdistro}
\end{figure}

\cite{Kacprzak2011MgII} combined multiple previous studies to characterize the equivalent width distribution function, $f(W_r)$. It is important to note, for comparison, that their sample with $W_r < 0.3$~{\AA} spans redshifts from $0.4 \le z \le 1.4$, while their sample with $W_r \ge 0.3$~{\AA} spans $0.4 \le z \le 2.3$. They found a Schechter function with a low equivalent width slope of $\alpha = -0.642 \pm 0.062$ and an exponential cutoff of $W^* = 0.97 \pm 0.056$~{\AA} best fit the data. In Figure~\ref{fig:totalewdistro}, we perform the same analysis with the total sample of our survey, finding a faint end slope of $\alpha = -0.91 \pm 0.04$ and an exponential cutoff at $W^* = 1.69 \pm 0.26$~{\AA}. The point of tension between these studies lies in the value of the low equivalent width slope. \cite{Kacprzak2011MgII} combine very different surveys in order to sample the full equivalent width distribution, leading to a non-uniform data set. Specifically at the low equivalent end of the distribution, we note that the error in their determination of $\alpha$ is smaller than the scatter in the data. In private communication with the authors, they speculate that differences in analysis methods of low equivalent width ${\MgII}$ absorption line surveys, along with unreported covariance in the fitted parameters, lead to an underestimation of the uncertainties in their functional fits.

We now aim to calculate the matter density of ${\MgII}$ absorbers across cosmic time. To do so, we employ the following equation,

\begin{equation}
\Omega_{\MgII} = \frac{H_0\  m_{\mathrm{Mg}}}{c\ \rho_{c,0}} \int_{N_{min}}^{N_{max}}\, f (N_{\MgII})\, N_{\MgII}\, dN_{\MgII} ,
\label{eqn:omega}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $H_0$ is the Hubble constant today, $m_{\mathrm{Mg}} = 4.035 \times 10^{-23}~\mathrm{g}$, $c$ is the speed of light, $\rho_{c,0}$ is the critical density at present, $f(N_{\MgII})$ is the column density distribution of ${\MgII}$ absorbers, and $N_{\MgII}$ is the column density. Using our derived fit to the column density distribution, we are able to numerically integrate the first moment from $0 < \log N({\MgII}) < 20~\mathrm{cm^{-2}}$. The results are shown below in Figure~\ref{fig:omegamgii}.

\end{figure}

$1\sigma$ uncertainties are derived with a bootstrap Monte-Carlo method. We select random column densities, with replacement, from the sample of measured column densities for all of our ${\MgII}$ absorbers until we reach a sample size of 1180. We then recalculate the column density distribution, find the best parameterized Schechter fit, and then integrate and compute Equation~\ref{eqn:omega}. We perfom this task 1024 times to develop a statistical distribution of values for $\Omega$. We take the standard deviation about the mean of this ensemble of simulated measurements as the $1\sigma$ uncertainty in $\Omega_{MgII}$. We find that the cosmic mass density of ${\MgII}$ increases from $\Omega_{\MgII} \simeq 0.8\times10^{-8}$ at $z \sim 0.5$ to $\Omega_{\MgII} \simeq 1.3\times10^{-8}$ at $z \sim 2$. 

\subsection{Potential Causes for Trends}
\label{sec:trendcauses}

The most obvious conclusion to be drawn from our analysis of ${\MgII}$ absorbers in The Vulture Survey is that around redshift $z \sim 2$, the physical conditions affecting ${\MgII}$ absorbers change. When we compare the sample of ${\MgII}$ absorbers at $z \sim 0.5$ to the sample of absorbers at $z \sim 2$, we find the following statements are true of the higher redshift sample:

\begin{enumerate}
\item There are more strong ${\MgII}$ absorbers per redshift path length and per absorption path.
\item The faint end slope of the equivalent width and column density distributions is flatter.
\item The ``knee'' of the Shechter fit to the equivalent width and column density distributions lies at higher values of $W_r^{\lambda2796}$ and $N(\MgII)$.
\item The cosmic mass density of ${\MgII}$ is larger.
\end{enumerate}

\noindent We can now state that the physical properties driving the global distribution of ${\MgII}$ absorbers at $z \sim 0.5$ are different than at $z \sim 2$. Possible explanations relate to the ionization conditions in the halos of galaxies at this time, the metallicity of gas around galaxies, or the quantity of metals in the circumgalactic medium, which we will now explore.

\cite{Haardt2012} represents the most recent and robust estimate of the cosmic ionizing background as a function of redshift, which is the primary ionizing component responsible for the universal ionization state of gas in galactic halos. The authors found a higher comoving emissivity for photon energies above $3~\mathrm{eV}$ at $z = 3.0$ as compared to lower redshifts near $z = 1.0$. As the number of ionizing photons in the IGM increases with increasing redshift, holding constant the density and quantity of metals in galactic halos, we would nominally expect for the ionization parameter of absorbers in the halos of galaxies to increase with redshift. Increasing the ionization parameter alone should decrease the observed quantity of ${\MgII}$, as it favors lower ionization parameter conditions. This is not what we observe in our sample, and we therefore disfavor the hypothesis that changes in ionzation conditions in the halos of galaxies could drive the observed increase in the number of strong ${\MgII}$ absorbers at redshift $z \sim 2$ compard to $z \sim 0.5$. 

The metallicity of galaxy halos has been best characterized by studies of DLAs and sub-DLAs, such as~\cite{Rafelski2012} and~\cite{Quiret2016}. They found a rough trend of decreasing metallicity with increasing redshift dominated by scatter. These high column density systems certainly do not trace all ionized gas in the halos of galaxies; however, it has also been shown that the gas phase metallicity of star forming galaxies is 0.35 dex lower at $z \sim 2$ than at $z \sim 0$~\citep{Yuan2013}. Assuming, then, that over time the overall metallicity of the circumgalactic medium increases, it would make no sense to observe larger quantities of ${\MgII}$ at $z \sim 2$ compared to $z \sim 0$. In fact, metals should build up over time in the halos of galaxies, producing stronger ${\MgII}$ absorption at lower redshift. Cosmic metallicity evolution alone, then, cannot explain the slightly enhanced cosmic mass density of ${\MgII}$ absorbing gas at $z \sim 2$ as compared to $z \sim 0$.

This leaves us, then, with the most likely conclusion being that galaxies eject more gas into their halos at $z \sim 2$ than at any other time. \cite{Behroozi2013sfr} combined data from 19 independent studies from $2006-2012$, spanning redshifts from $0 < z < 8$, to examine evolution in the cosmic star formation rate. They found that galaxies at $z \sim 2$ were forming stars at higher rates than any other time in cosmic history. It follows then that galaxies were ejecting more metal-enriched gas at $z \sim 2$ than at present through supernovae-driven outflows. Therefore, despite competing factors such as a more intense ionizing background and lower cosmic metallicity at higher redshifts, $\Omega_{\MgII}$ is larger at $z \sim 2$ than at present as a result of galaxy feedback processes ejecting large quantities of gas into their halos. 

Studies associated with COS-Halos seeking to understand the distribution of metals around galaxies have found the majority of cool, metal absorbing gas lies within the virial radius of galaxies~\citep{Peeples2014}. \cite{Stern2016} also found that the mean cool gas density profile around galaxies scales as $R^{-1}$, with most strong, low ionization metal absorbers existing near the galaxy itself. This means that the ${\MgII}$ absorbers observed in The Vulture Survey likely lie within the virial radius of a galaxy. The ${\MgII}$ absorbing gas observed near $z \sim 2$ should eventually fall back onto its host galaxy, or stall at large radii and remain a permanent part of the host galaxy halo~\citep{Ford2014}. What we observe in the form of low redshift ${\MgII}$ absorbers therefore may not only be the result of outflows near the present epoch, but also the remnants of the most energetic time in cosmic history. 

We now favor a picture where galaxies, during the most active epoch of star formation in cosmic history, expell large quantities of metal enriched gas into their halos through star formation driven outflows at $z \sim 2$. These outflows manifest themselves in observations as strong ${\MgII}$ absorbers. Their destiny will be to eventually either fall back onto the galaxy and enrich the ISM or remain in the halo, subject to the cosmic ionizing background. Those absorbers which condense and accrete onto the galaxy are lost from observations at lower redshifts, while those which remain in the halo must fragment or decrease in density in order to produce the observed enhancement in the number of weak ${\MgII}$ absorbers at $z \sim 0$.

\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}

Using archival data from VLT/UVES and Keck/HIRES, we have undertaken the most complete survey of ${\MgII}$ absorbers in 602 quasar spectra in high resolution ($\sim 7~\mathrm{\kms}$) allowing for the detection of both strong and weak {\MgII} absorbsers. Our survey spans absorption redshifts from $0.18 < z < 2.57$, allowing for characterization of the evolution of the distribution of these absorbers across cosmic time. Using our own detection and analysis software, we are able to accurately characterize the equivalent width detection limit, absorption path length, and survey copmleteness to a level allowing for an accurate determination of $dN\!/dz$, the equivalent width distribution function, the column density distribution function, and the total cosmic mass density of {\MgII} absorbers. Our main findings are as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
\item We find 1180 intervening ${\MgII}$ absorption line systems with equivalent widths from $0.003$~{\AA} to $8.5$~{\AA}, and redshifts spanning $0.14 \le z \le 2.64$. 
\item We present the distributions of the number of absorbers per unit redshift, $dN\!/dz$, and the comoving ${\MgII}$ line density, $dN\!/dX$, as a function of minimum equivalent width threshold and as a function of redshift. We parameterize the evolution in $dN\!/dX$ specifically with an emperical fit to the distribution in the form of $dN\,/dX = \frac{c}{H_o}n_0\,\sigma_0(1 + z)^{\epsilon}$, showing $\epsilon$ increases from $\epsilon=-1.11$ for all absorbers with $W_r^{\lambda2796} \ge 0.01$~{\AA} to $\epsilon=0.88$ for absorbers with $W_r^{\lambda2796} \ge 2$~{\AA}. Low equivalent width absorbers are more prevalent at low redshift, whereas the highest equivalent width absorbers are more prevalent near $z \sim 2$.
\item We derive a closed form analytic parameterization of $dN\!/dX$ for all ${\MgII}$ absorbers. As shown in Equation~\ref{eqn:dndxanalytic}, $dN\!/dX$ can be expressed as a function of $W_{r,\mathrm{min}}^{\lambda2796}$ and $z$. In this parameterization, we also show how the comoving opacity, $n_0\,\sigma_0$, and evolution parameter, $\epsilon$ evolve with increasing minimum sample equivalent width (see Figure~\ref{fig:nsigmaepsilon}). These form a physical basis for understanding how the comoving line density of ${\MgII}$ absorbers evolves over cosmic time. 
\item The equivalent width distribution function and the column density distribution function for ${\MgII}$ absorbers are both well fit by a Schecter Function, with a characteristic normalization, faint end slope, and exponential cutoff. Both functions show redshift evolution, specifically in the faint end slope, with this slope becoming shallower for redshifts near $z \sim 2$. There exist proportionately more high equivalent width, high column density ${\MgII}$ absorbers near $z \sim 2$.
\item The cosmic mass density of ${\MgII}$ absorbing gas, $\Omega_{\MgII}$, increases from $\Omega_{\MgII} \simeq 0.8\times10^{-8}$ at $z = 0.5$ to $\Omega_{\MgII} \simeq 1.3\times10^{-8}$ at $z \sim 2$.
\item We interpret these trends as owing to the increased star formation activity in galaxies at $z \sim 2$, ruling out other possible drivers such as changes in the ionizing radiation at these times and changes in the cosmic metallicity. This physical interpretation relies on galaxies creating more metal enriched gas at this time through supernovae driven winds, expelling it into the circumgalactic medium.
